## Installation
Clone this repo in your machine, then install the following libraries:

[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

[Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

[Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

## How to use
Run gui.py to launch the user interface.

File Path: Either paste the path to the image you want to convert to ASCII or use the button on the right to navigate and select an image.

Width: Width controls the maximum number of characters to be displayed on a line. if it's too low then the image probably won't look good, if it's too high you won't be able to see the full image unless you scale down the console. A number between 50 and 250 usually works well.

Dithering: Some images look better with dithering enabled while others will look awful. Test which one you prefer

Character color output: Select at least one color or any combination you want.

Hit Preview and then click Generate to print the ASCII image on the console.
